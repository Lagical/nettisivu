        <p><b>Music.</b> I listen to variety of music all the time and update my playlists, which currently contain over 15000 songs in total. 
            I also enjoy making all kinds of music myself.
            It's nothing serious, mostly goofy songs, but it is a very fun hobby! You can listen to some of my electronic tracks here
